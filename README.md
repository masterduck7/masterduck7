## Hi! 👋

### I'm Luis, a Chilean Senior Backend developer and Junior Frontend Engineer. I'm a responsible, motivated person facing new challenges and also a passionate traveler that always tries to learn more about the world.

#### 💻 My code is mainly focused in Web Development and a couple of hybrid mobile apps.
#### ⭐ My favourite stack is Python (Django or Flask) and Javascript (React JS or Angular), but I've worked in some projects with another languages like NodeJS or C#.
#### 🌱 I’m currently learning more about React JS to improve my frontend skills and Flutter for mobile applications.

#### 💬 You can reach me through my [Personal Website](https://www.lpsoftware.dev) or my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-ramirez-duarte/)
